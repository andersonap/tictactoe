# Tic Tac Toe 2.1

If you are not acquainted with the game Tic Tac Toe, here you can find the rules for the classical game: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe

We brought the pen-and-paper classical game to the digital age, but with a little twist: 
- The size of the playfield are configurable between 3x3 and 10x10.
- The number of players are configurable.
- The symbols (usually O and X) are configurable.
- The type of the players are configurable (real players or bots).

Feel free to change the file named 'config' as you want.
